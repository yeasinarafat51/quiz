    Step 1: Basic HTML Questions

  1. What is HTML? Explain its purpose & Basic Syntax Of HTML ? 
  answer:
  The primary purpose of HTML is:
Structure: It organizes web content into headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and more.
Content Semantics: Tags provide meaning to content, helping search engines and browsers understand what each section is about.
Linking: HTML enables links (hyperlinks) to other pages, creating a navigable web structure.
Embedding Media: It supports adding images, videos, and other multimedia.
Foundation for CSS & JavaScript: HTML forms the skeleton of a page, which is styled by CSS and made interactive by JavaScript.

Basic Syntax of HTML
An HTML document follows a structured format:
<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <a href="https://www.example.com">This is a link</a>

    Explanation:

<!DOCTYPE html>: Declares the document type as HTML5.
<html>: The root element that contains all HTML content.
<head>: Contains metadata, including the title of the page displayed on the browser tab.
<title>: Sets the title that appears on the browser's title bar or tab.
<body>: Holds the main content, including text, links, images, and more.
<h1>: Heading tag for primary headers (can also be <h2>, <h3>, etc., for subheadings).
<p>: Paragraph tag, used for blocks of text.
<a>: Anchor tag, which creates a hyperlink to another page or resource.


 2. What are HTML tags? How are they structured? Give Us 5 Tags As A Example. 

 answer:
 HTML tags are code snippets that define elements within an HTML document. 
 These tags tell the browser how to display various types of content on a webpage, like text,
  images, links, and multimedia. HTML tags typically come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag,
   with the closing tag marked by a forward slash (/), e.g., <p>...</p>. Some tags, known as self-closing tags,
    do not have closing pairs, such as <img />.

    Structure of HTML Tags:
HTML tags are enclosed within angle brackets and follow a standard syntax:
<tagname>Content goes here</tagname>

For self-closing tags:<tagname />

Examples of HTML Tags:
<h1>...</h1>

Usage: Defines a heading. The <h1> tag is typically the largest heading, used for main headings on a page.
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>

    <p>...</p>

Usage: Defines a paragraph. It is used to contain text in block format.
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

<a href="URL">...</a>

Usage: Defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the link's destination.
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>

<img src="URL" alt="description" />

Usage: Embeds an image. The src attribute provides the image path, and alt offers a text alternative if the image doesn't load.

<img src="logo.png" alt="Website Logo" />

<ul>...</ul> and <li>...</li>

Usage: Creates an unordered list. Each item in the list is enclosed in <li> tags.

    <ul>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
      </ul>

      Each HTML tag has specific purposes and properties that contribute to a webpage's structure and content display.



      3.What is the difference between <head>, <body>, and <html> tags? & the role of the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration?
        answer:
        The <html>, <head>, and <body> tags each serve unique purposes in an HTML document structure, while the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines the document type. Here’s a breakdown of each:

            1. <html> Tag
            Purpose: The <html> tag is the root element of an HTML document. It wraps all the content and tags within a webpage, signaling the start and end of the document.
            Structure:
            <!-- <html>
  <!-- The entire content of the webpage goes here -->
</html> -->

     <!-- 2.<head> Tag -->
    <!-- Purpose: The <head> tag contains metadata, scripts, styles, and other settings for the document that don’t display directly on the webpage.
    Common Elements in <head>: -->
    <title>: Sets the page title shown on the browser tab.
    <meta>: Provides metadata like character set and viewport settings.
    <link>: Links external resources, like stylesheets.
    <!-- <script>: Embeds or links JavaScript. -->
    Example:
    <head>
        <title>My Webpage</title>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
      </head>

      3.<body> Tag
        Purpose: The <body> tag contains all the visible content on a webpage, including text, images, links, forms, and other elements.
        Structure:
        <body>
            <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
            <p>This is my webpage content.</p>
          </body>

          Role of <!DOCTYPE html>
Purpose: The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration is a directive that informs the browser which version of HTML is used. In modern HTML5 documents, it appears as <!DOCTYPE html>, indicating that the page is using HTML5.
Placement: It is always placed at the very top of the HTML document, before the <html> tag.
Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>...</head>
  <body>...</body>
</html>


4.Describe the function of the <title> tag. Where does it appear With Example. 
    answer:
    The <title> tag defines the title of an HTML document, which is crucial for user experience and SEO. Here’s a detailed explanation:

        Function of the <title> Tag
        Primary Role: The <title> tag specifies the title displayed in the browser’s title bar or tab.
        SEO: The title is important for search engine optimization (SEO), as search engines use it to understand the main topic of the page, and it often appears as the clickable headline in search results.
        Bookmarking: When a user bookmarks a page, the title is used as the label, making it easier for users to find the page later.
        Placement
        The <title> tag is placed within the <head> section of an HTML document and can only contain text.
        Example
        Here’s a basic example of how the <title> tag is used:
            <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>About Our Company - ABC Corp</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to ABC Corp</h1>
    <p>Learn more about our company's mission and values.</p>
  </body>
</html>

Appearance
In this example, the browser will display "About Our Company - ABC Corp" on the tab or title bar.
In search engine results, this title often appears as the link title.

5.How do you add comments in HTML, and why are they useful?
answer:
In HTML, comments are added using the syntax <!-- Comment here -->. Anything between <!-- and --> will be ignored by the browser, meaning it won’t appear on the webpage.

How to Add Comments
Here's an example of a comment in HTML:
<!-- This is a comment in HTML -->
<p>This is visible content on the webpage.</p>
<!-- The paragraph above is about the main topic of the page -->
Why Comments Are Useful
Code Documentation: Comments allow developers to describe sections of code, making it easier to understand when revisiting later or collaborating with others.
Debugging: Comments can temporarily "disable" code by wrapping it, helping developers test and troubleshoot issues without deleting code.
Organizing Code: Comments can be used as headers or dividers, making code more organized and readable, especially in larger files.
Leaving Notes: They allow developers to leave notes or reminders, which can help during updates or further development.
